# DA-Project1-Automating-Data-Cleaning

This project is all about Automating a Data Cleaning Process in Python ad SQL.

1. We started by listening to our client's requests
2. Then we CREATED A DATABASE with the necessary tables 
3. Created two ready-for-pipeline Classes with methods to transform the incoming data (.txt and .xml formats)
4. Created a pipeline Class to insert clean data into the database.

The result was a new SQL database with clean data and Python pipeline classes to continue storing company data for further analysis.

Done by me & my Adalab team, Team Totoro
